       		<p>There is no rule that sets the number of a maximum number of essay paragraphs, although the minimum number is three paragraphs. Some people say an essay ought to have five paragraphs, which is somewhat a limiting rule. However, how long should college essays be? If you have been instructed to write a five-paragraph essay, then you have to stick to it</p>
